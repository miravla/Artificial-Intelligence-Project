- [To fulfill users' bored time during their free time]


##  B. ABSTRACT 

A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carries symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.

Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.

## C.  DATASET

In this project, we’ll discuss about meme chatbot, detailing how our computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented.

From there, we’ll review the dataset we’ll be using to train our meme chatbot.

I’ll then show you how to implement a Python script to train a meme chatbot on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow.

We’ll use this Python script to train a smeme chatbot and review the results.

Given the trained meme chatbot, we’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

- Detect the key word of the sentence input from user
- Reply with funny contain and sentence to user

We’ll wrap up the post by looking at the results of applying our meme chatbot.


There is an example of the meme chatbot will be looked like as shown in Figure 2:

In order to train a meme chatbot, we need to break our project into two distinct phases, each with its own respective sub-steps (as shown by Figure 1 above):

- Training: We will focus about how the chatbot will detect the key word or sentence of the input from user and reply them with some funny sentence 

- Deployment:After the chatbot is trained to reply, we will focus on the design of the meme chatbot like the colour and some icon design.

We’ll review each of these phases and associated subsets in detail in the remainder of this tutorial.

Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect the sentence input from a user and reply it with funny sentence.



## D.   PROJECT STRUCTURE

The following directory is our structure of our project:

The bot should somehow maintain the state of the conversation and respond to the user request in the current context (aka., it needs to be context aware).



## F.  RESULT AND CONCLUSION

The meme Chatbot is just so fun to be used.

You can then launch the meme chatbot everywhere and everytime with just your smartphone:
